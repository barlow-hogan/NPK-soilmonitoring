# NPK Soil Monitoring System

The **NPK Soil Monitoring System** is an innovative Internet of Things (IoT)-based solution designed to monitor and analyze soil conditions in real-time. By leveraging advanced sensors and a Raspberry Pi, this system measures critical soil parameters like temperature, humidity, pH, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) levels. This data is continuously collected, analyzed, and displayed on both a local Raspberry Pi display and a remote web UI, providing actionable insights for modern agriculture.

## Key Features:
- **Real-Time Sensor Readings:** The system uses a CWT-NPK soil sensor to measure essential soil parameters, helping users make informed decisions about soil health and crop needs.
- **IoT Connectivity:** Data from the sensors is transmitted to an online MongoDB database, enabling easy access and long-term storage for analysis and comparison across different fields and time periods.
- **Web Interface:** The web UI displays live sensor data for temperature, humidity, pH, and NPK levels. It is designed to be user-friendly, allowing easy monitoring of soil health from any device with a web browser.
- **Local Display Interface:** The Raspberry Pi features a 3.4-inch display that shows real-time data in a compact and easily readable format, making it ideal for on-site monitoring.
- **Data Visualization:** The system utilizes Pygame to display the collected data on the Raspberry Pi in a visually appealing and informative manner.
- **Cloud Integration:** Sensor readings are synced with an online MongoDB database, allowing for remote access and ensuring data integrity and backup.
- **User-Friendly UI:** The web and local UIs are designed to present the data clearly, providing users with immediate insights into the soilâ€™s health.

## System Components:
- **Raspberry Pi:** The heart of the system, providing computing power and display capabilities for both local data visualization and IoT connectivity.
- **CWT-NPK Soil Sensor:** A sensor that measures soil temperature, humidity, pH, and NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) levels, providing vital information for agricultural applications.
- **MongoDB Database:** The database stores sensor data in real-time, enabling easy retrieval for analysis and long-term monitoring.
- **Web Interface (Flask-based):** A web application built with Flask that displays the real-time sensor data, making it accessible from any device on the local network or over the internet.

## Benefits for Agriculture:
- **Optimized Crop Growth:** By regularly monitoring soil conditions, farmers can adjust irrigation, fertilization, and other practices to optimize crop growth.
- **Water and Resource Conservation:** With accurate and timely data on soil moisture and nutrient levels, farmers can reduce water and fertilizer usage, contributing to more sustainable farming practices.
- **Increased Yield:** By ensuring that soil conditions are always at their best, farmers can increase crop yield and improve overall soil health.
- **Ease of Use:** The web and local display interfaces make it easy for users to understand and react to soil data, even with minimal technical knowledge.
